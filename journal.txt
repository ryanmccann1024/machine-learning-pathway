As of right now my plan is to do the refresher stage on its own. Then, move into Google's intro to ML course and
the basic ML algorithms. The math related to these algorithms will then be referenced in the stats and matrices books
I have. But, I intend to read and take notes (locally) for now cover to cover, skipping when I need to reference things
about certain algorithms. Let's see how this goes!
